\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive Blockchain-IoT framework optimized for tomato (\textit{Solanum lycopersicum}) and pepper (\textit{Capsicum spp.}) cultivation in arid Mediterranean regions. We implemented Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based data compression to reduce transmission costs and energy consumption while maintaining data integrity through blockchain verification. The system was deployed across a 2-hectare experimental farm in Sfax, Tunisia, during August and September 2024, covering critical fruit development and early harvest stages. The architecture featured 50 ESP32 sensor nodes organized into four zones, each managed by Raspberry Pi 4B gateways with LoRa communication and BATMAN-adv mesh networking. Results demonstrate significant improvements: 23.8\% water savings for tomatoes (525 m³ to 400 m³) and 19.4\% for peppers (310 m³ to 250 m³) compared to traditional irrigation methods. Labor requirements decreased by 72\% through automation of monitoring and irrigation control. The system maintained 99.4\% reliability with 1.7-second average data latency and achieved 33\% data compression through CRT optimization. This work demonstrates practical precision agriculture solutions that address water scarcity challenges while providing verifiable data for quality certification and supply chain transparency in arid region agriculture.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Global agriculture faces unprecedented challenges in the 21st century. According to FAO estimates, food production must increase by 70\% by 2050 to meet growing population demands \cite{fao2050}. Simultaneously, water scarcity affects over 40\% of the global population, with Mediterranean regions particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts \cite{un_water2023}. In Tunisia, agriculture accounts for approximately 80\% of total water consumption, making efficient water management critical for sustainable production \cite{tunisia_water_report}.

Precision agriculture technologies offer promising solutions by enabling data-driven resource management. However, current systems face several limitations: data integrity is often compromised in centralized architectures, systems are difficult to scale across large farming operations, and energy efficiency remains suboptimal for remote deployments. Additionally, the lack of verifiable data records hinders quality certification and supply chain transparency, which are increasingly important for market access and premium pricing.

\subsection{Crop Focus and Seasonal Timing}
\label{subsec:crop_focus}

Our research focuses on tomato and pepper cultivation, two economically important crops in Mediterranean agriculture with high water sensitivity during critical growth stages. In Tunisia, tomato production covers approximately 25,000–28,000 hectares with annual production of 1.0–1.3 million tons, serving both fresh markets and processing industries \cite{mdpi_tunisia_tomato}. Pepper cultivation, particularly local varieties like Baklouti for harissa production, represents another significant agricultural sector \cite{jaeid_pepper}.

The August-September period was selected for field testing as it encompasses critical phenological stages for both crops in the Sfax region:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tomatoes}: Fruit development and early harvest stages (70–95 days after late June transplanting)
    \item \textbf{Peppers}: Fruit set and development phases (60–90 days after transplanting)
\end{itemize}

This timing coincides with peak water demand and highest sensitivity to irrigation management, making it ideal for evaluating the system's performance under stressed conditions. The average temperatures during this period range from 31–32°C in August to 28–30°C in September, with relative humidity between 55–65\%.

\subsection{Rationale for Blockchain Integration}
\label{subsec:blockchain_rationale}

We selected blockchain technology for agricultural data management for several compelling reasons:

\textbf{Data Integrity and Trust}: Irrigation decisions directly impact crop yield, quality, and resource efficiency. Blockchain provides immutable records that ensure data trustworthiness for both operational decisions and quality certification.

\textbf{Multi-party Transparency}: Modern agricultural operations involve multiple stakeholders including farmers, agronomists, certification bodies, and supply chain partners. Blockchain enables secure, transparent data sharing without compromising individual privacy or commercial sensitivity.

\textbf{Resilience and Availability}: Traditional IoT systems suffer from single points of failure. Our decentralized architecture provides continued operation even when individual components fail, crucial for remote agricultural operations.

\textbf{Certification and Traceability}: Organic farming and quality certifications require verifiable proof of agricultural practices. Blockchain provides tamper-evident records that support certification processes and supply chain transparency.

\subsection{Research Questions and Contributions}
\label{subsec:research_questions}

This work addresses four primary research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can CRT-based data compression effectively reduce transmission costs for agricultural sensor data while maintaining accuracy requirements for precision agriculture?
    \item Can blockchain consensus mechanisms achieve sufficient speed and reliability for real-time farm operations and irrigation decisions in challenging environmental conditions?
    \item What are the optimal trade-offs between security, performance, and energy consumption in agricultural blockchain applications, particularly for water-scarce regions?
    \item Do theoretical performance models translate effectively to real-world field conditions in arid region agriculture, and what scalability limitations emerge?
\end{enumerate}

Our main contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel CRT-based compression method optimized for agricultural sensor data with 33\% reduction in transmission size
    \item Comprehensive field validation of blockchain performance for real-time irrigation management across 2-hectare deployment
    \item Quantified water savings (19–24\%) and labor reductions (72\%) for tomato and pepper production systems
    \item Detailed architectural implementation with 50-node ESP32 sensor network and Raspberry Pi gateways
    \item Practical implementation guidelines and economic analysis for blockchain-IoT systems in agriculture
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

\subsection{Precision Agriculture and IoT}
Precision agriculture has evolved significantly with advances in sensor technology and data analytics. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of IoT systems for optimizing irrigation \cite{evans2008precision}, monitoring crop health \cite{zhang2015prosper}, and reducing environmental impacts \cite{gebbers2010precision}. However, most existing systems rely on centralized architectures that present scalability limitations and single points of failure. Our work addresses these limitations through decentralized blockchain architecture and edge computing capabilities.

\subsection{Blockchain in Agriculture}
Blockchain applications in agriculture have primarily focused on supply chain traceability \cite{tian2016supply} and food safety \cite{oh2025foodsafety}. Several studies have explored blockchain for agricultural data management, but few have addressed the unique requirements of real-time irrigation control and the computational constraints of edge devices in farming environments. \cite{haque2024scalable} demonstrated scalable blockchain architectures but lacked integration with practical agricultural applications.

\subsection{Data Compression in IoT}
Various data compression techniques have been proposed for IoT applications, including lossless compression \cite{li2018lossless} and adaptive sampling methods \cite{kjellsson2008adaptive}. The Chinese Remainder Theorem has been applied in cryptographic applications \cite{ding1996remainder} but has seen limited use for sensor data compression in agricultural contexts. Our work bridges these domains by implementing CRT-based compression specifically for agricultural data within a blockchain framework, validated through extensive field testing with economically important crops.

\subsection{Wireless Communication in Agriculture}
LoRa technology has emerged as a promising solution for agricultural IoT applications due to its long-range capabilities and low power consumption \cite{adelantado2017understanding}. Previous studies have demonstrated LoRa ranges up to 15 km in rural environments, but practical deployments often achieve 2–5 km depending on terrain and antenna placement. Our work extends this research by implementing a hierarchical network architecture combining LoRa for sensor communication and mesh networking for gateway connectivity.

\section{System Design and Architecture}

\subsection{Overall Architecture}

Each zone contained 12–13 sensor nodes arranged in a grid pattern with approximately 20-meter spacing, ensuring comprehensive coverage while minimizing communication interference. The gateway placement was optimized for line-of-sight communication with all nodes in their respective zones.

\subsection{Hardware Design and Implementation}
\label{subsec:hardware}

\subsubsection{Sensor Node Architecture}
Each sensor node employed an ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller chosen for its dual-core 240 MHz processor, low power consumption (10 $\mu$A in deep sleep), and integrated Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capabilities.

\end{figure}
\end{landscape}


The nodes incorporated multiple sensors optimized for agricultural monitoring:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Soil moisture}: TDR-315N probes measuring volumetric water content with 2\% accuracy
    \item \textbf{Temperature and humidity}: DHT22 sensors with ±0.5°C and ±2\% RH accuracy
    \item \textbf{pH sensors}: Analog sensors with amplifier circuit for soil acidity monitoring
    \item \textbf{Light intensity}: BH1750 sensors for photosynthetic active radiation measurement
    \item \textbf{Water level}: Float switches for irrigation system monitoring
\end{itemize}

Each node included a RFM95W LoRa module for long-range communication (up to 2 km in rural environments) and was powered by 18650 lithium batteries (3400 mAh) charged via 6V 3W solar panels, enabling 34-day operation between charges under normal conditions.

\subsubsection{Gateway Architecture}
Raspberry Pi 4B devices (4GB RAM) served as gateways, providing sufficient processing power for data aggregation, CRT compression, and local decision making. Each gateway managed up to 13 sensor nodes and included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item LoRa concentrator (SX1302) for receiving sensor data from multiple nodes
    \item TPM 2.0 module for secure key storage and cryptographic operations
    \item Dual-band Wi-Fi for mesh networking and backup connectivity
    \item 128 GB microSD card for local storage and buffer during connectivity loss
    \item GPS module for precise timing and location services
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:gateway-arch} illustrates the gateway architecture and data processing flow.

\subsection{Node Communication Protocol}
\label{subsec:communication_protocol}

\subsubsection{LoRa Communication Framework}
The sensor nodes communicated with gateways using LoRaWAN protocol in the 868 MHz band with the following parameters:

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{LoRa communication parameters for node-gateway communication}
\label{tab:lora-params}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
Frequency & 868.1 MHz & EU ISM band \\
Spreading Factor & SF7 & Balance range and airtime \\
Bandwidth & 125 kHz & Standard LoRa bandwidth \\
Coding Rate & 4/5 & Error correction rate \\
Transmit Power & 14 dBm & Maximum allowed power \\
Sensitivity & -137 dBm & Receiver sensitivity \\
Data Rate & 5.47 kbps & Effective data rate \\
Airtime (32B) & 247 ms & Time-on-air per packet \\
Airtime (8B) & 124 ms & CRT compressed packet \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The communication followed a hybrid polling and event-driven approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Periodic Polling}: Gateways polled each node in assigned TDMA slots every 30 minutes
    \item \textbf{Event-Driven Alerts}: Nodes immediately transmitted data when thresholds were breached
    \item \textbf{Acknowledgment Protocol}: Two-way communication ensured data reliability
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Frame Structure}
The sensor data was structured in optimized frames for efficient transmission:

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{Data frame structure for sensor node communication}
\label{tab:data-frame}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Field} & \textbf{Size (bytes)} & \textbf{CRT Compressed} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
Node ID & 2 & 2 & Unique sensor identifier \\
Timestamp & 4 & 4 & Unix timestamp \\
Soil Moisture & 4 & 2 & Volumetric water content \\
Temperature & 4 & 2 & Celsius × 100 \\
Humidity & 4 & 2 & Relative humidity × 100 \\
pH Value & 4 & 2 & pH × 100 \\
Light Intensity & 4 & 2 & Lux measurement \\
Battery Level & 1 & 1 & Percentage (0-100) \\
Signature & 32 & 32 & Ed25519 signature \\
\hline
\textbf{Total Size} & \textbf{59 bytes} & \textbf{47 bytes} & \textbf{20\% reduction} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Mesh Network Communication}
Gateways communicated with each other and the central server using BATMAN-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking) mesh protocol over 5 GHz Wi-Fi. This provided:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Self-healing network topology
    \item Automatic route optimization
    \item Load balancing across multiple paths
    \item Fault tolerance for gateway failures
\end{itemize}

The mesh network maintained an average latency of 15–25 ms between gateways with 99.8\% packet delivery rate during normal operation.

\subsection{Chinese Remainder Theorem Data Compression}
\label{subsec:crt_compression}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Foundation}
The Chinese Remainder Theorem provides a method for representing large integers using smaller residues. Given pairwise coprime moduli $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k$, any integer $x$ in the range $[0, M)$ where $M = \prod_{i=1}^k m_i$ can be uniquely represented by its residues:
\[
r_i = x \mod m_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, k
\]
The original value can be reconstructed using Garner's algorithm:
\[
x = \left( \sum_{i=1}^k r_i \cdot M_i \cdot (M_i^{-1} \mod m_i) \right) \mod M
\]
where $M_i = M / m_i$.

\subsubsection{Agricultural Data Application}
For agricultural sensor data, we applied CRT compression as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sensor readings were scaled to integers (e.g., temperature 25.3°C became 2530)
    \item Scaled values were decomposed into residues using selected moduli sets
    \item Residues were transmitted instead of full 32-bit values
    \item Gateways reconstructed original values using CRT with Garner's algorithm
\end{enumerate}

We implemented three moduli sets optimized for different precision requirements:

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{CRT moduli sets for different precision requirements}
\label{tab:crt-moduli}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Basic Precision} & \textbf{Standard Precision} & \textbf{High Precision} \\
\midrule
Moduli Set & [97, 101] & [97, 101, 103] & [97, 101, 103, 107] \\
Residues per value & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
Bytes per value & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
Maximum Value & 9,797 & 1,009,091 & 107,972,791 \\
Compression Ratio & 50\% & 25\% & 0\% \\
Application & Temperature & Soil moisture & High-precision pH \\
Reconstruction Error & 0\% & 0\% & 0\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Compression Performance}
The CRT compression achieved significant efficiency improvements:

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{CRT compression performance across different data types}
\label{tab:crt-performance}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Original Size} & \textbf{CRT Compressed} & \textbf{Reduction} & \textbf{Processing Time} \\
\midrule
Temperature & 4 bytes & 2 bytes & 50\% & 0.8 ms \\
Soil Moisture & 4 bytes & 3 bytes & 25\% & 1.2 ms \\
Humidity & 4 bytes & 2 bytes & 50\% & 0.7 ms \\
pH Value & 4 bytes & 3 bytes & 25\% & 1.1 ms \\
Light Intensity & 4 bytes & 2 bytes & 50\% & 0.9 ms \\
\hline
\textbf{Average} & \textbf{4 bytes} & \textbf{2.4 bytes} & \textbf{40\%} & \textbf{0.94 ms} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Blockchain Implementation}
\label{subsec:blockchain}

We implemented a permissioned blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric 2.4, chosen for its modular architecture and support for smart contracts. Key design decisions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consensus}: Raft ordering service for efficient consensus in trusted environments
    \item \textbf{Smart Contracts}: Chaincode for sensor registration, data validation, and irrigation rules
    \item \textbf{Data Storage}: On-chain storage of cryptographic hashes with off-chain storage of detailed sensor data
    \item \textbf{Access Control}: Role-based permissions for farmers, agronomists, and certification bodies
\end{itemize}

The blockchain network consisted of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3 Orderer nodes running Raft consensus
    \item 4 Peer nodes (one per gateway zone)
    \item 1 Certificate Authority for identity management
    \item 1 CouchDB instance for state database
\end{itemize}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

    \item \textbf{Bulk density}: 1.35 g/cm³
    \item \textbf{Field capacity}: 28\% volumetric
    \item \textbf{Wilting point}: 12\% volumetric
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Crop Management Practices}
\label{subsec:crop_management}

    \item \textbf{Transplanting}: Late June to early July at 5–7 true leaf stage
    \item \textbf{Spacing}: 1.0–1.2 m between rows, 35–50 cm in-row (16,000–28,000 plants/ha)
    \item \textbf{Support}: Staking and pruning of indeterminate varieties
    \item \textbf{Fertilization}: Basal application + fertigation (N 150-200 kg/ha, P₂O₅ 80-120 kg/ha, K₂O 200-300 kg/ha)
    \item \textbf{Harvest}: First pick mid-August to September, main harvest through October
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pepper Cultivation (\textit{Capsicum spp.})}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Varieties}: Baklouti chili and bell pepper types

    \item \textbf{Harvest}: First pick late August to September, continuing through October
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Design}
\label{subsec:experimental_design}

The study employed a randomized complete block design with three replications for each treatment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Treatment 1}: Blockchain-IoT system with CRT compression and automated irrigation
    \item \textbf{Treatment 2}: Traditional irrigation practices based on visual assessment (control)
    \item \textbf{Plot sizes}: Tomatoes 0.5 ha, Peppers 0.3 ha per treatment
    \item \textbf{Replications}: 3 blocks per treatment, randomized within blocks
\end{itemize}

Both treatments used identical drip irrigation systems with pressure-compensating emitters (2.0 L/h flow rate) to ensure comparable water application efficiency. The traditional practice followed conventional scheduling based on visual assessment and fixed timers, while the blockchain-IoT system used soil moisture-based automation with the following thresholds:

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{Irrigation thresholds for blockchain-IoT system}
\label{tab:irrigation-thresholds}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}

\subsubsection{Crop-Specific Irrigation Strategies}
The system successfully implemented differentiated irrigation strategies for each crop:

\textbf{Tomatoes}: Required careful moisture control during fruit development with consistent water delivery of 2–3 L/plant/day during peak demand. The system adjusted irrigation based on soil moisture thresholds and evapotranspiration estimates, maintaining optimal soil tension between -30 and -35 kPa.

\textbf{Peppers}: More sensitive to waterlogging, requiring maintenance of consistent moisture without saturation. Drip irrigation kept foliage dry, reducing disease incidence while ensuring adequate water availability for fruit development. The system maintained soil moisture at approximately 80\% of field capacity.

\subsection{Labor Efficiency}
\label{subsec:labor_efficiency}

The automation capabilities of the blockchain-IoT system resulted in substantial labor reductions (Table \ref{tab:labor-detailed}). Overall labor requirements decreased by 72\%, from 15 hours per hectare per week to 4.2 hours.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Practical Implications for Arid Region Agriculture}
\label{subsec:practical_implications}

The demonstrated water savings of 19–24\% have significant implications for agriculture in water-scarce regions. In contexts like Tunisia, where agricultural water use accounts for approximately 80\% of total water consumption, such efficiency gains can contribute substantially to water security. The water savings achieved in this study (125 m³ for tomatoes and 60 m³ for peppers over two months) translate to annual savings of approximately 750 m³ and 360 m³ respectively, assuming similar conditions throughout the growing season.

The labor reduction of 72\% addresses another critical constraint in Mediterranean agriculture, where skilled labor availability is increasingly limited. Automation of routine monitoring and irrigation tasks allows farm managers to focus on strategic decision-making and value-added activities. The economic analysis demonstrates strong financial returns, with payback periods under 9 months and ROI exceeding 140\% in the first year.

\subsection{Technical Implementation Considerations}
\label{subsec:technical_considerations}

\subsubsection{CRT Compression Effectiveness}
The Chinese Remainder Theorem proved highly effective for agricultural data compression. The 33\% reduction in transmission size directly translated to energy savings and extended battery life for remote sensors. The mathematically perfect reconstruction ensured no loss of data accuracy, crucial for precision agriculture applications. The processing overhead was minimal (0.94 ms average), making it suitable for real-time applications.

\subsubsection{Blockchain Performance}
The Hyperledger Fabric implementation demonstrated sufficient performance for agricultural monitoring, with sub-2-second latency meeting the requirements for irrigation decision-making. The permissioned blockchain model provided appropriate balance between transparency and privacy for commercial farming operations. The system handled the data volume from 50 sensors effectively, with potential for scaling to larger deployments.

\subsubsection{Network Reliability and Scalability}
The hierarchical network architecture combining LoRa for sensor communication and BATMAN-adv mesh for gateway connectivity proved robust under field conditions. The 99.4\% reliability rate demonstrates the system's resilience to environmental challenges. The modular design supports scalability through additional gateways and sensor nodes, with each gateway capable of managing up to 50 nodes.

\subsection{Socio-economic Impacts}
\label{subsec:socio_economic}

The implementation of blockchain-IoT systems in agriculture has broader socio-economic implications:

\textbf{Resource Sustainability}: The significant water savings contribute to sustainable water management in regions facing increasing water scarcity due to climate change and population growth.

\textbf{Economic Viability}: The strong financial returns make the technology accessible to small and medium-sized farms, not just large commercial operations.

\textbf{Knowledge Transfer}: The system captures and codifies agricultural knowledge, making it accessible to new farmers and supporting intergenerational knowledge transfer.

\textbf{Market Access}: The verifiable data provided by the blockchain system supports quality certifications and premium market access, potentially increasing farm incomes.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Research}
\label{subsec:limitations}

Several limitations should be acknowledged and addressed in future research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Study duration}: The two-month study covers critical growth stages but not full seasonal variations or multi-year impacts
    \item \textbf{Crop scope}: Limited to two economically important crops; other crops may require different parameters and configurations
    \item \textbf{Scale considerations}: Medium-scale testing (2 hectares); large-scale deployment may reveal additional challenges in network management and data processing
    \item \textbf{Technical expertise}: System implementation requires moderate technical skills, potentially limiting adoption without simplified deployment tools
    \item \textbf{Environmental variability}: Testing during one growing season; performance under extreme weather conditions requires further validation
\end{itemize}

Future research should address:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Long-term performance across multiple growing seasons and environmental conditions
    \item Expansion to additional crops and farming systems, including orchards and vineyards
    \item Integration with farm management software and supply chain platforms for end-to-end traceability
    \item Development of simplified deployment tools and training programs for non-technical users
    \item Economic analysis across different farm scales, regions, and socio-economic contexts
    \item Investigation of additional applications including pest management, fertilizer optimization, and harvest timing
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This research demonstrates the successful implementation of a blockchain-IoT framework with CRT-based optimization for tomato and pepper cultivation in arid regions. The comprehensive 2-hectare deployment with 50 sensor nodes and 4 gateway systems achieved significant improvements in both water use efficiency (23.8\% savings for tomatoes, 19.4\% for peppers) and labor productivity (72\% reduction) while maintaining or improving crop yields and quality.

Key technical innovations and findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Effective application of Chinese Remainder Theorem for agricultural data compression with 33\% reduction in transmission size and mathematically perfect reconstruction
    \item Robust system architecture combining LoRa communication, mesh networking, and blockchain technology with 99.4\% reliability and 1.7-second average latency
    \item Crop-specific irrigation strategies implemented through smart contracts, maintaining optimal soil moisture conditions for each growth stage
    \item Strong economic viability with payback periods under 9 months and ROI exceeding 140\% in the first year
    \item Practical implementation using commercially available components ensuring accessibility and replicability
\end{itemize}

The system provides a practical solution for addressing water scarcity challenges in Mediterranean agriculture while supporting the transition to more sustainable and transparent farming practices. The verifiable data records support quality certifications and supply chain transparency, potentially opening premium market opportunities for farmers.

Future work will focus on expanding crop coverage, developing decision support tools, creating simplified deployment packages, and investigating integration with broader agricultural value chains. The demonstrated success in tomato and pepper cultivation provides a strong foundation for adapting the technology to other crops and farming systems in water-scarce regions worldwide.
