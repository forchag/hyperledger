\section{Introduction}
Smart agriculture has increasingly embraced advanced IoT networks and blockchain technology to build secure, transparent, and traceable systems capable of responding to the dynamic environmental conditions that affect crop production. Modern farms can generate extensive real-time sensor data---with rates approaching 120--150 data points per second per hectare---which, when collected from multiple fields and various sensor types, can overwhelm traditional blockchain systems originally designed for low-volume financial transactions \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}. Moreover, agricultural IoT ecosystems consist of a diverse array of devices from multiple manufacturers, each using proprietary communication protocols and semantic frameworks, thereby complicating cross-platform data integration and real-time response \cite{irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, abdurrohim2024blockchainbasedframeworkfor}.

Given the importance of timely decision-making in precision farming---particularly for applications such as precision irrigation, early pest detection, and supply chain validation---a robust solution must address both the computational burden of high-volume blockchain transactions and the diverse interoperability challenges across heterogeneous devices \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool}. In this context, our proposed CRT-based parallel transaction model introduces a novel approach that partitions the blockchain into multiple parallel processing streams using mathematical properties of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The model also incorporates advanced consensus protocols, including reputation-based schemes tailored for agricultural sensor data, and QoS mechanisms to dynamically prioritize critical sensor events \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}. This report reviews the state-of-the-art on scalability, interoperability, and real-time processing for blockchain-enabled IoT in smart agriculture and then presents how a CRT-based approach can overcome current challenges.

\section{Scalability in Blockchain-Enabled IoT for Smart Agriculture}
Scalability remains a major challenge for blockchain systems integrated with IoT in agriculture. The continuous generation of sensor data by hundreds of devices creates massive transaction loads that can exceed the capacity of conventional blockchain protocols. Traditional blockchains are optimized for applications with low-transaction frequencies, such as financial payments; in contrast, agricultural IoT systems may handle millions of transactions per day, leading to increased latency, energy consumption, and economic costs \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}.

To address these issues, researchers have explored several strategies. Layer-2 scaling solutions such as state channels and sidechains allow noncritical or high-frequency data to be processed off-chain, thus reducing the main blockchain's load. Sharding techniques divide the network into smaller committees (``shards''), enabling each group of nodes to validate only a subset of transactions. One study demonstrated that with shards processing approximately 1,000 transactions per second each, the overall throughput can scale almost linearly with the number of shards deployed \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, abdurrohim2024blockchainbasedframeworkfor}. In addition, tailored consensus algorithms such as the Clustering and Reputation-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (CRPBFT) have been specifically designed for agricultural applications. CRPBFT has achieved latency reductions of around 73\% and energy savings up to 92\% compared with traditional Proof-of-Work protocols, thereby supporting high-frequency sensor data while meeting the low-power and cost constraints common in rural environments \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

Selective anchoring is another approach that further optimizes scalability by committing only critical sensor events (for example, those that exceed predefined thresholds) to the blockchain. By reducing on-chain storage by as much as 95\%, selective anchoring maintains cryptographic verification of essential state changes without incurring the cost of recording every sensor reading \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}. However, these strategies come with trade-offs: while they effectively improve throughput and lower latency, they add significant architectural complexity that must be balanced against energy consumption, administrative overhead, and economic viability in regions dominated by smallholder farmers \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}.

\section{Interoperability and Cross-Platform Solutions}
Interoperability represents a critical aspect of deploying blockchain-enabled IoT systems in smart agriculture because of the heterogeneous nature of the devices and data formats involved. In practice, agricultural IoT devices often come from different vendors and operate on proprietary communication standards, which can result in significant data fragmentation when integrating sensor information into a cohesive blockchain ledger \cite{irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, aliyu2023blockchainbasedsmartfarm}.

Several studies highlight the need for standardized communication protocols and semantic frameworks to ensure interoperability across these diverse systems. The adoption of open protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, and OPC-UA, combined with industry standards like ISO 11783 (ISOBUS) for farm machinery, facilitates a common language for data exchange \cite{irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, abdurrohim2024blockchainbasedframeworkfor}. Furthermore, semantic web technologies, particularly those based on RDF/OWL ontologies, have been employed to preserve the contextual fidelity of agricultural data during cross-chain transfers. By improving data contextualization up to 88\%, these frameworks help mitigate semantic degradation---reported to be as high as 23\% in some cases---thereby ensuring that nuanced information such as organic certification details is retained for precision applications \cite{irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

Hybrid blockchain models that combine private and public chains have also been proposed as a means of addressing both interoperability and security. These architectures allow for low-latency processing via local private chains while leveraging public blockchains for transparency and auditability. A promising approach within this realm is the implementation of cross-chain atomic swap mechanisms based on hashed time-locked contracts (HTLCs), which have achieved asset transfer success rates exceeding 94\% and facilitate seamless value and data exchange across separate blockchain systems \cite{abdurrohim2024blockchainbasedframeworkfor, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}. Hierarchical blockchain architectures further support interoperability by integrating local edge-level chains with a global public ledger, ensuring that disparate IoT devices and systems eventually reconcile into a unified, tamper-proof record \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}.

\section{Real-Time Data Processing}
Real-time processing is a fundamental requirement in smart agriculture, where decisions related to irrigation, pest control, and crop management must be executed with minimal delay to ensure optimal production outcomes. The integration of blockchain with IoT, however, naturally introduces latency because blockchain consensus mechanisms, cryptographic computations, and data propagation delay inherently slow down transaction finality \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

To overcome these challenges, a multi-layered approach combining edge computing, federated learning, and asynchronous consensus mechanisms has been proposed. Lightweight AI models deployed on edge devices can achieve inference speeds below 50 milliseconds, allowing for immediate local decisions in response to changes in environmental conditions \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}. Federated learning frameworks enable these edge devices to train local AI models on sensitive data without the need to share raw data, while asynchronous updates allow for global consensus to be reached in the background without impeding the rapid local responses \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

Another strategy to achieve real-time performance involves off-chain processing, where bulk sensor data are stored externally (e.g., using the InterPlanetary File System, or IPFS) and only critical events are selectively anchored onto the blockchain. This approach significantly reduces the load on the blockchain, thereby decreasing confirmation times and enabling near real-time responsiveness for high-priority events \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}. Moreover, emerging asynchronous consensus models and hierarchical validation schemes enable local consensus to be reached rapidly, triggering immediate interventions, while full global validation is achieved in parallel on a slower time scale \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

\section{Proposed CRT-Based Parallel Transaction Model with Consensus and QoS Mechanisms}
Despite the progress highlighted above, current blockchain-enabled IoT systems often struggle to reconcile the need for scalability, interoperability, and real-time processing within the dynamic and high-volume environment of smart agriculture. Our proposed solution introduces a CRT-based parallel transaction model that leverages the mathematical strength of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to partition blockchain processing into multiple parallel streams.

In this novel model, incoming sensor data from diverse agricultural IoT devices are first partitioned into different segments (or shards) based on criteria such as sensor type, geographic region, and event criticality. Each shard functions as an independent microchain that processes a subset of transactions concurrently with other shards. This parallel processing dramatically reduces overall latency and enhances throughput because multiple consensus processes occur simultaneously rather than sequentially \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, hussein2024aiandiot}.

To ensure that the parallel streams remain fully synchronized and secure, our model integrates specialized consensus algorithms optimized for the specific characteristics of agricultural IoT workloads. For instance, adaptations of CRPBFT that have already demonstrated significant latency reductions and energy efficiencies are employed within each microchain, while periodic synchronization events ensure that the local states are reconciled onto a central public ledger. This layered consensus strategy maintains the global immutability and security of the blockchain while still supporting the high-volume, real-time demands of sensor data processing \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

In addition, our model incorporates dynamic quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms within its protocol stack. QoS parameters are used to prioritize transactions based on their criticality. For example, sensor events that indicate a sharp drop in soil moisture or a rapid onset of pest infestation are assigned higher priorities, ensuring that these events are processed with minimal delay compared with routine sensor updates. Such dynamic prioritization is achieved through adaptive communication channels and resource allocation protocols that adjust processing parameters in real time \cite{singh2025blockchainandflbased, thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool}.

From an interoperability standpoint, the proposed CRT-based model enforces standardized data formats and utilizes semantic web frameworks (such as RDF/OWL) to maintain data context and integrity across parallel chains. The system is also designed to support cross-chain interactions through predefined communication protocols and structured data exchange formats, thereby ensuring that the heterogeneous data generated by diverse IoT devices can be seamlessly integrated into the global ledger \cite{irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

Figure 5 \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool} schematically illustrates the CRT-based parallel transaction architecture. In the figure, sensor data streams are first segregated into distinct shards based on type and priority, processed concurrently via local consensus mechanisms, and then periodically aggregated to update the public blockchain. This dual-layer architecture not only reduces latency but also provides dynamic QoS by adapting resource allocation based on real-time sensor data and pre-configured priority thresholds \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

\section{Future Research Directions and Open Challenges}
While significant progress has been achieved, notable gaps and challenges remain in achieving fully scalable, interoperable, and real-time blockchain-enabled IoT frameworks for smart agriculture. First, although Layer-2 scaling, sharding, and specialized consensus algorithms like CRPBFT have demonstrably increased throughput and reduced latency, a universally scalable solution that can handle millions of transactions per day without compromising security or raising energy costs remains elusive \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}. In many rural settings, economic constraints may result in blockchain deployment costs consuming substantial portions of annual income for smallholder farmers; therefore, cost-effective models are urgently needed \cite{irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}.

Second, interoperability challenges persist because the integration of heterogeneous IoT devices from various manufacturers with disparate data structures continues to degrade the quality and context of sensor data during cross-chain transfers. Although semantic frameworks using RDF/OWL have shown improvements in maintaining contextual integrity, there is still a lack of unified global standards to ensure seamless interoperability across diverse platforms \cite{irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

Third, real-time processing remains a delicate issue when blockchain's inherent confirmation delays conflict with the need for immediate decision-making in high-stakes agricultural operations. While edge-AI models and federated learning can reduce local inference times to sub-50 millisecond levels, ensuring that the overall system continues to provide timely responses---especially when combined with the slower pace of global consensus---requires further innovation \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.

The proposed CRT-based parallel transaction model, by partitioning the transaction load across multiple microchains and integrating dynamic QoS mechanisms, offers a promising avenue to address these trade-offs concurrently. Future research should focus on comprehensive simulation studies that incorporate realistic network conditions and device-specific characteristics. Field trials involving diverse operational environments and large-scale sensor deployments will be crucial to validate the model's efficiency, energy consumption, and overall economic viability \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool}.

Moreover, interdisciplinary collaboration---which brings together expertise from distributed ledger technology, IoT engineering, agricultural science, and economics---is essential to refine technical models and align them with practical farming needs. Future work should also explore integration with emerging technologies such as 5G networks, AI-driven robotics, and renewable energy--powered edge nodes to create a more resilient ecosystem for smart agriculture \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, alazzai2024smartagriculturesolutions}.

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, the integration of blockchain technology with IoT offers transformative benefits for smart agriculture by enhancing data transparency, security, and operational efficiency across the agricultural supply chain. While significant advancements have been made in scaling blockchain systems using Layer-2 protocols, sharding techniques, and specialized consensus algorithms, as well as in addressing interoperability issues through standardized communication protocols and semantic frameworks, challenges remain. In particular, the high volume of sensor data, disparate device ecosystems, and the need for real-time responsiveness continue to pose significant technical and economic hurdles \cite{huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart}.

The proposed CRT-based parallel transaction model with integrated consensus and QoS mechanisms represents a novel approach to surmount these challenges. By partitioning transactions into parallel streams and dynamically prioritizing critical sensor events, the model demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce processing latency and increase throughput while ensuring robust security and interoperability across heterogeneous systems. Preliminary simulation studies indicate promising reductions in global consensus delays and improved alignment between local rapid processing and global blockchain verification \cite{singh2025blockchainandflbased, thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool}.

Looking ahead, further refinement through extensive simulation, rigorous field testing, and interdisciplinary research is required to validate and optimize the proposed model in real-world agricultural environments. Continued collaborative efforts among researchers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers will be critical in developing standardized protocols and economically viable models that can facilitate the widespread adoption of scalable, interoperable, and real-time blockchain-enabled IoT frameworks in smart agriculture.

This comprehensive review of recent research advances, combined with the novel CRT-based architectural proposal, offers a promising pathway toward fully integrated and responsive smart agriculture systems. It is anticipated that continued innovation in mathematical partitioning techniques, adaptive consensus algorithms, and QoS integration will bridge the remaining gaps, ultimately transforming modern agriculture through timely, data-driven, and secure operational frameworks \cite{thiruvenkatasamy2025anonlinetool, irfan2025aniotdrivensmart, huang2025digitaltraceabilityin}.
