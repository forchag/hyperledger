    Note over ESP32: Sample sensors every 1-5 min. Detect thresholds and delta-rate events. Maintain monotonic sequence.
    ESP32->>PI: Leaf payload (device_id, seq, window_id, stats, last_ts, sensor_set, urgent, crt optional, sig)\nWi-Fi WPA2/3
    PI-->>ESP32: ACK or keepalive (optional commands)
    Note over ESP32,PI: HMAC or Ed25519 signature. Optional CRT residues at leaf.

    PI->>INGRESS: Forward payload (local)
    INGRESS->>INGRESS: Verify signature, dedupe by device and sequence, reconstruct CRT via Garner if present
    INGRESS->>BUNDLER: NormalizedReading

    alt Periodic window
        BUNDLER->>SCHED: Interval bundle (window 30-120 min)
        SCHED->>MESH: Submit bundle on cadence (gRPC over TLS tunneled via WireGuard)
    else Event flow
        BUNDLER->>SCHED: Event bundle (coalesce 60-120 s, rate limit)
        SCHED->>MESH: Submit bundle immediately (gRPC over TLS)
    end

    Note over MESH: L2 routing via BATMAN-adv on bat0. 2-5 ms per hop. Tens of Mbps with WokFi links.
    MESH->>ORDERER: Fabric envelope to orderer cluster (Raft)
    ORDERER->>PEERS: Ordered block broadcast
    PEERS->>CC: Endorse validate commit (chaincode invoked)
    CC-->>PEERS: Chaincode events emitted

    PEERS->>METRICS: Increment counters and gauges on commit
    METRICS->>PROM: Expose /metrics for scraping (HTTP pull)
    PROM->>DASH: Render graphs and tables (15 s scrape)
    PROM->>ALERTS: Fire alerts on rules (latency, backlog, health)
    ALERTS->>OP: Notify via email or webhook
    DASH->>OP: Visualization and drilldowns

    Note over SCHED,PEERS: After submit, wait for commit event; do read-back verification of one key; log submit to commit latency.
