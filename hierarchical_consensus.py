"""Hierarchical network simulation for smart agriculture.

Demonstrates how constrained IoT sensors can split readings into
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) residues and participate in a
hierarchical consensus. Sensors send residues to zone gateways which
forward validated values to the farm server for block creation.

The core CRT arithmetic is delegated to :mod:`crt_parallel` so that all
components share the same implementation for decomposing and
reconstructing values.

The module also exposes :func:`run_advanced_consensus` which wires in the
more elaborate consensus pipeline from :mod:`advanced_consensus`. This
allows external callers to exercise Proof-of-Authority, PBFT and
Federated Byzantine Agreement flows without rewriting the simple
hierarchical demo.
