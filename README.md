# Hyperledger Farm Network

This directory contains a minimal example of integrating Hyperledger Fabric with IPFS and LoRa sensor nodes. The Fabric chaincode stores device registrations, sensor readings and network events.

## Chaincode

`chaincode/sensor/sensor.go` implements a Fabric chaincode that allows:

* Registering devices
* Recording sensor data with IPFS CIDs
* Logging network events
* Sending permissioned messages between devices

## Flask GUI

`flask_app/app.py` exposes a small HTTPS GUI and REST API to register devices, upload files, record sensor data and verify stored information. It expects a local IPFS daemon running on `localhost:5001` and a Fabric gateway configured via the stub `hlf_client` module. The dashboard shows how many nodes are registered and offers options to verify and recover data stored on IPFS.

Start the app with:

```bash
pip install flask ipfshttpclient
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out cert.pem -subj "/CN=farm"
python flask_app/app.py
```

Visit `https://<pi-ip>:8443/` to open the dashboard. Sensor data can also be posted directly to `/sensor`, files to `/upload`, or devices registered at `/register`.

## LoRa examples

`lora_node.py` shows how a sensor node can send sensor readings or periodic
heartbeat packets over LoRa using the `pySX127x` library. The companion
`network_monitor.py` listens for these heartbeats, logs them on the blockchain
and prints a list of discovered nodes every minute.

These scripts are stubs and can be run on a Raspberry Pi with appropriate radio
modules attached.

## Running a Fabric network

This repository does not include the full Fabric test network. Refer to the official [Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/) to bootstrap a network using the `test-network` samples. Deploy the chaincode in `chaincode/sensor` and update `hlf_client.py` to submit transactions via the Fabric SDK.

## Data tools and recovery demo

The `tools/data_tool.py` script provides a command line utility to upload sensor payloads to IPFS and store the resulting CID on chain. It can also retrieve and verify stored data:

```bash
python tools/data_tool.py upload sensor-1 reading.json
python tools/data_tool.py retrieve sensor-1
python tools/data_tool.py verify sensor-1
```

Simulated recovery of lost IPFS blocks is performed with:

```bash
python tools/data_tool.py recover sensor-1
```

These examples assume an IPFS daemon is running locally and that the chaincode has been deployed as described above.
The dashboard offers buttons for verifying and recovering data using the same logic.

## Blockchain design

This project uses **Hyperledger Fabric**, a permissioned blockchain platform. Peers
endorse transactions and store the ledger, while an ordering service
creates blocks using the RAFT consensus algorithm. Each block contains a
header with the number, the hash of the previous block, and the hash of
its transaction data. This hash chaining makes the ledger immutable â€“
any change would break the chain of hashes.

Sensor readings and heartbeat events are submitted through chaincode
(`sensor.go`). Each transaction is endorsed, ordered into a block, and
committed to all peers. Clients can query the ledger to retrieve device
information or verify data integrity.

### Inspecting and verifying blocks

The Fabric CLI can display high level ledger information:

```bash
peer channel getinfo -c mychannel
```

Specific blocks may be fetched and decoded using the CLI or the Python
`tools/block_inspector.py` utility:

```bash
python tools/block_inspector.py --info
python tools/block_inspector.py --block 2
```

The inspector prints the block header including `previous_hash` and
`data_hash`, allowing you to differentiate one block from another and
view the stored transactions.
